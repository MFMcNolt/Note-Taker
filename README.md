# Marion's Amazing Note Taker Application

## Description

Note Taker is a web application designed to streamline the process of taking and managing notes. The motivation behind this project was to create a simple yet effective tool that allows users to quickly jot down important information, access their notes, and delete them when necessary. This project served as an opportunity to apply and enhance my skills in building web applications using Express.js and working with JSON data. It also allowed me to practice my skills with Heroku and understand how to best utilize this application.

## Installation

To get the development environment up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Note Taker repository to your local machine using the following command: Git Clone https://github.com/MFMcNolt/Note-Taker.git
2. Navigate to the repository and use npm to install the required dependencies. Run the following command: npm install
3. Start the server by running the following command: node server.js
4. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000.

Now you have the Note Taker project installed and running locally on your machine. You can interact with the application by creating, saving, and deleting notes.

## Usage

To use the application, simply navigate to the hosted webpage, create a new note by clicking on the "New Note" button, write your note, and then save it using the "Save" button.

You can view your notes on the left side of the webpage and delete those notes you have preaviously saved.

## Features

- Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime used for building server-side applications.
- Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust web applications by providing a set of features for web and mobile applications.
- uuid: The uuid library is used for generating unique identifiers. It's employed in the Note Taker app to create unique IDs for each note.

These technologies work together to create a dynamic and functional note-taking application with a server-side component that handles the storage and retrieval of notes. The app is built on the Node.js runtime, utilizes the Express.js framework for handling routes and requests, and incorporates uuid for generating unique identifiers for notes.
